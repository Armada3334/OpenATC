# OpenATC
Open source repository aimed to provide the same service as LiveATC.net

# Inspiration
I love listening to https://www.lofiatc.com, but as of writing this, it seems that the backend they use (LiveATC.net) is blocking their access. I get it, using it for third party services is against their TOS. But turns out its based on open source software, as well as volunteers. What if we had an open source implementation with the same structure, but allowing anyone to make their own apps? No idea how the server hosting is going to work, but hey, we'll figure it out.
